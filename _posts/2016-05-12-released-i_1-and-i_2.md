Today, we have released issues 1 and 2 of the first volume of *al-Muqtabas*, complete with page breaks, links to facsimiles, strutural mark-up of articles, and bibliographic metadata. Note that currently facsimiles are only available from HathiTrust and that, depending on your ISP's location, you might not be able to see them because access is restricted to US-IPs.
