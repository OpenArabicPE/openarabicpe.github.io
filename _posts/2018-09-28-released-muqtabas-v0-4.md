We just released v0.4 of the journal *al-Muqtabas*. This release includes structural mark-up and page breaks based on the digital facsimiles of the first edition (sic!)[^1] for all issues of volume 1. In addition, this release comprises all previously released files.

- vol. 1: complete
- vol. 4: complete
- vol. 5: complete
- vol. 6: complete


I wish to express my gratitude to the following contributors, who helped with the mark-up of page breaks:

- Manzi Tanna-HÃ¤ndel: volume 1, issues 10 to 12.
- Layla Youssef: volume 4, issues 7 to 12.
- Dimitar Dragnev: volume 5, issues 2 to 12.

[^1]: The TEI boilerplate based webview will default to facsimiles of the second edition. Page breaks occasionally differ between the two editions.
