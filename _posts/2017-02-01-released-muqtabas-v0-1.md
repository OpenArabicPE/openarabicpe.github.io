We just released v0.1, the first proper release, of the journal *al-Muqtabas*. As per our release schedule this release includes the following:

- TEI files of all twelve issues of the **sixth** volume of *al-Muqtabas* with tructural mark-up of mastheads, sections, articles, and with page breaks linked to the facsimiles;
- MODS and BibTeX files for all issues, sections, and articles;
- Copies of TEI schema files from [OpenAraPE_ODD](https://github.com/OpenArabicPE/OpenArabicPE_ODD);
- A local installation of the TEI Boilerplate for Arabic editions;
- all XSLT stylesheets necessary for various transformations from sources (shamela) and to other formats (md), for generating bibliographic metadata (MODS, BibTeX), for improving mark-up, linking page breaks to facsimiles, etc.
