Over the course of the recent weeks and with the help of our intern Layla Youssef, we have released issues 5/6 to 12 of the fourth volume of *al-Muqtabas*, complete with page breaks, links to facsimiles, strutural mark-up of articles, and bibliographic metadata. Note that depending on your ISP's location you might not be able to see facsimiles from HathiTrust because access is restricted to US-IPs.
