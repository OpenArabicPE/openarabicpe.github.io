We just released v0.1 of the journal *al-Ḥaqāʾiq* published by ʿAbd al-Qādir al-Iskandarānī. As per our release schedule this release includes the following:

- TEI files of all twelve issues of the **first** volume of *al-Ḥaqāʾiq* with tructural mark-up of mastheads, sections, articles, and with page breaks linked to the facsimiles;
- MODS and BibTeX files for all issues, sections, and articles;
- A local installation of the TEI Boilerplate for Arabic editions;

I wish to express my gratitude to the following contributors, who helped with the mark-up of page breaks:

- Talha Güzel: volume 1, issues 8 and 10.
- Xaver Kretzschmar: volume 1, issue 11.

Thanks to the efforts of CERN's [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) platform we even got a DOI! [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1232175.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1232175)
