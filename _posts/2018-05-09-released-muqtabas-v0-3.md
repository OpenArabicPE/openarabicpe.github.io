After a long gap, that saw me return to Beirut after a prolonged parental leave, we just released v0.3 of the journal *al-Muqtabas*. This release includes structural mark-up and page breaks based on the digital facsimiles for all issues of volume 4. In addition, this release comprises all previously released files.

- vol. 4: complete
- vol. 5: complete
- vol. 6: complete

I wish to express my gratitude to the following contributors, who helped with the mark-up of page breaks:

- Dimitar Dragnev: volume 5, issues 2 to 12.
- Layla Youssef: volume 4, issues 7 to 12.
