Endangered Archives Programme EAP119: digization of the periodical holdings in the *al-Aqṣā* Mosque library (Jerusalem).


- [home](https://eap.bl.uk/project/EAP119), [doi: 10.15130/EAP119](https://doi.org/10.15130/EAP119)
- what: digital facsimiles of 24 periodicals. Lists of titles are available in various papers published by the project. Facsimiles are hosted through the British Library using IIIF since 2017(?)
    + >The project resulted in the digitisation of 24 titles, 6,699 issues and 53,783 pages. Source: [wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20121102143352/http://eap.bl.uk/database/overview_project.a4d?projID=EAP119)
        + at a grant value of £ 50.200, this boils down to roughly £1 per image! Is this much?
        + >So to summarize the above, for a medium-sized project of 50,000 newspaper pages you might expect to need a budget of around $50,000 in year 1, with ongoing costs of approximately $7,000 per year. Souce: [Veridian](https://veridiansoftware.com/knowledge-base/veridian-pricing/)

    + >The digitisation process was conducted in-house on the grounds of the Al-Aqsa Library. The images created as a direct result of the image capture process represent preservation quality digital masters. Two copies of each digital master in TIFF format were created for this project. The first set of archival TIFF files is stored on the dedicated external drive at the Al-Aqsa Library. The second set was burned on DVDs and deposited at the British Library. The accompanying documentation on the collection, project, publisher, and series level was also created and deposited at the British Library. Source: [project website][eap119]

    + quality: rather poor image quality. Many page photographs are badly lit and out of focus.
        - This is particularly true for the Beiruti newspaper (*al-Maḥabba*) (EAP119/1/7), and especially the left pages. Good examples would be pages 629, 641, or 679 (http://eap.bl.uk/EAPDigitalItems/EAP119/EAP119_1_7_39-EAP119_mah19011020_629_L.jpg, http://eap.bl.uk/EAPDigitalItems/EAP119/EAP119_1_7_40-EAP119_mah19011027_641_L.jpg, http://eap.bl.uk/EAPDigitalItems/EAP119/EAP119_1_7_42-EAP119_mah19011110_679_L.jpg).
    + Follow Cordell 2017's suggestion to take OCR (and facsimiles) seriously; study EXIF data, hardware and software stacks, etc.
        * *al-Muqtabas*; vol. 7: EXIF dates: 23. September 2008, 5. July 2009. The timestamp in the EXIF data indicates that this is not the original date of photography since it would mean that the photographed more than 60 pages per minute which is impossible with the equipment they have.
- when:
    + EAP award: 2007, 12 months (according to the EAP119 [project website][eap119])
    + scanning
        * >The digitization guidelines were established at the beginning of the project and were based on the general copying guidelines available to the Endangered Archives Programme participants (Endangered Archives Programme, 2009) and technical guidelines of the National Digital Newspaper Program (Library of Congress, 2009). Source: {Matusiak 2009@7}

        * The EXIF data for some images claims 23. Sep 2008 at 13:56:16 as timestamp
    + cataloguing
        + 2009/10: [blog post](https://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/endangeredarchives/2010/01/suppression-of-the-arabic-press-during-the-british-mandate.html) by Lynda Barraclough on the EAP119 material
    + website online?
        * 2012-05-15: [announcement](https://blogs.bl.uk/endangeredarchives/2012/05/more-eap119-content-online-and-updated-guidelines.html) for the latest installment of EAP119 being online; by Lynda Barraclough
            - a search on this blog does not return any other hits for EAP119
        * an annoucement of the partial publication was published on H-Turk on 5. Apr 2012
        * wayback machine: first version dated to [2012-11-02](https://web.archive.org/web/20121102143352/http://eap.bl.uk/database/overview_project.a4d?projID=EAP119); it mentions the paper presentad in August 2009 and must have therefore been published/updated at a later point
        * I have harvested data for the first time in early January 2013
- who:
    + Krystyna Matusiak, project consultant. at the time she was still a PhD student [source](https://portfolio.du.edu/kmatusia)
    + Qasem Abu Harb, project coordinator
        * according to [this website](https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/sarah-irving/endangered-archives-program-opens-priceless-palestinian-heritage), he is member of the CBRL, but the [CBRL website](https://cbrl.ac.uk/) doesn't find him (2019-12-16)
    + Lynda Barraclough, cataloguer at the BL
    + Paul Young, the EAP Cataloguer (as per email communication)
- how:
    + since the timeline and the embedded metadata are at odds and because images are of rather poor quality, I do not trust the project manager's statement that the periodicals were digitised with "ATIZ BOOK Drive system with two digital cameras" ({Matusiak 2009@7})
    + 2009 [ATIZ BookDrive](http://blog.atiz.com/2009/07/15/new-bookdrive-capture-v3-2-2-1-and-capture-slave-v1-1-3-0-just-released-download-now/)
        - ATIZ website in [2008](https://web.archive.org/web/20080701040827/https://www.atiz.com/) for the specs of their BookDrive DIY see [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20080701125544/http://diy.atiz.com/specs/). This machine and the two DSLRs would have been able to produce much higher quality than EAP119 provides.

# EXIF data

- After the switch to IIIF in September 2017, original imagery is not available online anymore. To get to the EXIF data, one must examine copies downloaded at an earlier point or enquire with the BL
    + it is weird, BL serves a higher quality image through the Universal Viewer than the JPG linked in the IIIF manifesto
        * example: EAP119/1/19/1
            - [UV](https://eap.bl.uk/archive-file/EAP119-1-19-1#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=0&xywh=-259%2C-197%2C2917%2C3933)
            - [Jpg from IIIF manifesto](https://images.eap.bl.uk/EAP119/EAP119_1_19_1/1.jp2/full/full/0/default.jpg)
                + size: 814 x 1200 px, this is ⅓ smaller than the JPG avaiable until they moved to IIIF
        + it seems that no matter what I do, the download of a single-tile JPG is limited to 1200px in any dimension. This is certainly not an IIIF issue per se, but the BL implementation to prevent harvesting of higher resolution images

            * this means that the IIIF JPG was generated by a new conversion from an archive version

# Scanning cost

- Veridian estimates
    + scanning from paper to be around USD 0.30+ per page
    + create digital METS/ALTO object without article segmentation: USD 0.10 - 0.50
- [Digitization Cost Calculator](http://dashboard.diglib.org)
    + estimate 245,42 hrs with the ATIZ BookDrive, which would mean 0,294 minutes per page
